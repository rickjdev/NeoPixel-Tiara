# NeoPixel-Tiara
Augmented LED driver for the AdaFruit NeoPixel Tiara project by Becky Stern.

See https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixel-tiara/build-it for instructions on how to compile and load it into the Gemma.

The original driver flashes randomly. This version adds color sets and sequenced patterns.

I'm not affiliated with AdaFruit, but I'll include their request here: "Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code, please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing products from Adafruit!"
